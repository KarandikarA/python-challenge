# PyBank 
 
For this part of the assignment, we had to analyze the dataset budget_data.csv and had to calulate 

-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The program found the folliwng 

Financial Analysis
....................................................................................

# Acknowledgments 
For this assignment, I used the BCS learning assistent to help me fix some csv coding problems. My tutor was David Friedman. In addition, I attended office hours on Thursday, July 6th to ask for help on how to submit it to Github 
I also used the module 3 challenge instructions to guide me through the project. The code is within each PyPoll and PyBank folders under the file main.py.
